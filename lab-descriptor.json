  "introduction": "The Engineering Chemistry Virtual Lab provides students with practical exposure to essential chemical concepts used in engineering applications. This lab includes experiments related to water analysis, solution chemistry, surface chemistry, adsorption, and reaction kinetics.<br> Through an interactive virtual environment, students can perform standard laboratory experiments such as titrations, hardness determination, surface tension measurement, and kinetic studies. These experiments help in understanding real-world chemical processes in a safe and accessible manner.",
